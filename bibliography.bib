  abstract  = "This paper focuses on a fairly new motivational technique, the
               so-called Gamification, which consists of introducing game
               mechanics in non-game environments to promote motivation and
               engagement. By the turn of the 21rst century, Gamification took
               off in the business field and soon after became an attractive
               concept for researchers and professionals in education as it
               appears to be an increasingly popular method to motivate
               learners. Nevertheless, it is still a nascent field in terms of
               empirical evidence available to firmly support its educational
               benefits. This paper intends to shed some more light on this
               topic through a comprehensive review of literature published in
               the most prominent journals. The present study is framed within
               the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) in higher
               education and Computer-Assisted Language Learning, and focuses
               on the effects of gamified learning environments on student's
               motivation and learning. A Meta-analysis method was used to
               explore relevant empirical research published between 2011 and
               2019. After reviewing a corpus of 68 papers drawn from the
               leading databases Scopus and Web Of Science, and from which only
               15 could be included in the study, we can point out two main
               findings: (i) there is still very limited literature in the
               field of SLA and, (ii) results seem to be predominantly positive
               in terms of motivation and engagement but only a few studies
               confirm clear interconnections with learning outcomes. The
               results suggest a lack of solid correlations between
               Gamification, motivation and cognitive processes.",

Databases including Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus were searched for this purpose, analyzing a total of 28 articles. The research methodology of this study was a systematic review. A content analysis method was used for analyzing the selected articles. Our findings found that after 2015, the use of gamification in LFL became popular among researchers, and the number of field studies increased rapidly over the past two years (2017–2018). Additionally, quantitative methods were found to be the most frequently used research methods regarding gamification in LFL studies. In the analyzed studies, vocabulary and grammar abilities were the most commonly investigated basic language skills. In addition, English language, Duolingo, high school, and feedback were the most commonly investigated Foreign language, gamified platform, education level, and gamification element for learning a new language in the reviewed articles. More analysis disclosed challenges, as well as advantages associated with using gamification in LFL. Furthermore, in studies examined concerning the effectiveness of using gamification in LFL, the results mainly pointed to the benefits of gamification based learning. The systematic review also provides valuable recommendations for future researches and practitioners.},

               to investigate the potential of gamified course design in
               language learning from students' perspective. Particularly, we
               explored students' experiences of engagement, enjoyability and

               interest and engagement, and gamification in language learning.
               Language learning is understood through socio-cultural and
               ecological approaches. The research was conducted and data were
               collected at a 3-credit field-specific English course. The
               participants (N = 23) were 1st-year healthcare students
               conducting their studies with a blended learning approach. The
               used applications were Seppo, Kahoot, Padlet and Quizlet. The
               data includes students' learning diaries and a post-course

  abstract  = "Gamification or game-based learning is the current trend in
               education which is steadily increasing its popularity across
               several fields involving academic learning. Gamification is the
               incorporation of gaming elements into a learning environment in
               order to increase engagement and participation. It enhances
               learner's participation, motivate actions, efficiently improve
               their academic performance as well as effectively facilitate
               language learning. Undoubtedly, participation is essential for
               an effective game-based language learning system. Language
               learning through games can take many forms, such as role-playing
               games to practice communication or board games to reinforce
               grammar. Furthermore, gamified learning software, for example,
               may boost student engagement, retention and academic
               performance. On the one hand, proponents of gamification claim
               that it improves learning. Gamification reinforces important
               educational skills like problem-solving, collaboration, and
               communication. Moreover, it is argued that the requirement for
               interaction in a gamified approach to education encourages
               students to participate actively in their education, resulting
               in increased student engagement in online forums, projects, and
               other learning activities. E-learning platforms seem to
               potentially enhance students' motivation, and great efforts are
               needed to develop and implement an experience to make it
               completely motivating to participants. Gamification research is
               gaining traction and promises to aid in the resolution of many
               issues. Hence, this article could potentially offer ideas to
               educators to design technology-mediated learning environments.
               Based on a review of various prior works, this article explored
               the many reasons gamification should be incorporated into school
               curriculums for language learning, as well as the benefits for
               learners. It also critically focused on the application of

               role of such case studies in influencing students' learning

               from 400 undergraduate students through an online questionnaire
               immediately after discussion of the case in Business Information
               Systems classes. Student learning from the case study was
               measured by two components consisting of case knowledge and case
               perceptions. The student course engagement questionnaire was
               used to examine engagement in skills, emotions, participation
               and performance while the study process questionnaire was
               administered to assess students' learning approaches.
               Additionally, the seven predominant roles of the feedback were
               used to analyse students' learning experience. Finally,
               students' learning outcomes were assessed both in group
               performance and individual performance. Structure equation
               modelling was applied to test the causal model. Findings -- The
               results revealed that the case study had a positive influence on
               students' engagement in skills and emotions. Moreover, case
               perceptions led students to surface approach in their learning.
               Furthermore, case knowledge had a positive impact on the
               learning experience. Research limitations/implications -- The
               study suggests that localized case studies should be designed
               cautiously. Furthermore the method of instruction regarding the
               method must be clearly explained for undergraduate students.
               Future research should consider a way of evaluating academic
               achievement as a result of using localized cases.
